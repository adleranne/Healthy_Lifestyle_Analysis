# Healthy_Lifestyle_Analysis
Final Data Analytics Bootcamp Project

Lifestyle is a diverse concept but usually referred to the way someone lives their live, which can be in a material/socio-economic context (e.g. expensive lifestyle, consumption habbits), socio-cultural related (e.g. urban lifestyle, certain believes/values/interests) or even health related (e.g. unhealthy lifestyle, work-life-balance). The research of lifestyle focussing on health and well being is part of the interdiscplinary field of "lifestyle medicine", which is "a branch of medicine focused on preventive healthcare and self-care dealing with research, prevention, and treatment of disorders caused by lifestyle factors" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_medicine).

This project takes the 'Lifestyle and Well Being' dataset from kaggle which is based on an online questionnaire from the www.Authentic-Happiness.com project, containing about 16.000 responses collected between 2015 and 2021 from all over the world. The goal of this project is to check which lifestyle features are contributing to a healthy bmi, which is one of the main influencing factors on lifestyle related deseases (like diabetes, heart desease etc.). The idea behind it is, that by trying to make certain healthy lifestyles popular and desirable it can help to influence peoples behaviour into the right direction instead of simply telling them what to eat and how much sport to do each week to obtain a healthy bmi.

Steps of analysis:

Data cleaning
EDA - focussing on Factor Analysis/PCA to reduce the 18 features of the questionnaire to lifestyle dimensions
Classification Analysis - checking, which features have a discriminative value in classifying a healthy bmi
